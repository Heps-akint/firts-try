# PRD

Purpose: the “what”. Stable, user-visible outcomes. Each item has an ID and acceptance criteria.
Completion signal: checkbox ticked.

## How to use
- Add new items freely.
- Never delete IDs; deprecate by noting “superseded by PRD-XX”.
- Each build iteration should complete at most ONE PRD item (or a clearly-scoped sub-item).
